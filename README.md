# Handwritten-Samples-Reconstruction

Construct a vanilla adversarial autoencoder to generate synthetic handwritten samples. There should be one encoder, one decoder, and one discriminator network in it. Three layers will be present in both the encoder and decoder networks. The discriminator will function as a binary classifier between real and fake images, with one input being the latent variables of all the images generated by the encoder and another being a random number of real samples chosen from a gaussian distribution.

Common specifications need to be followed are mentioned below:

• Dataset: MNIST

• Batch Size: 64

• Epochs: 100

• Optimizer: Adam • Loss Functions: a.BCE b.SSIM c. MSE

• No of intermediate nodes: 1000

• Laten Dimension feature tensor shape: 2 • Activation Function: ReLU / Sigmoid (use appropriately where necessary)

• Network Layer Type: Linear

• No of intermediate nodes in discriminator: 500 • Auto encoder network LR: 0.0001 • Discriminator network LR: 0.00005
